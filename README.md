# leads-tracker
This is a google chrome extension made by vanila javaScript, HTMl and CSS. User can bookmark a site link simply by clicking on 'SAVE TAB' button and can delete whenever they want.
Information that saved won't lost, cause localStorage had been used.

How to use this extension?
1. Clone/download the repository
2. go to chrome://extensions/
3. Turn on the Developer mode
4. Click Load unpacked and upload the file from local computer
Thats it

Though it's a extension, I have given below the live site link. Just check how it looks like or works.
